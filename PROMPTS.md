Include date and time, commit id and other useful metadata if available. | Initial prompt-log documentation update. | 28c44a8 | /workspace/codex_experiment_01 | Current working branch |
| 2026-02-06 15:52:16 UTC | Is it possible to include all the previous prompts to date? | Expanded prompt log to include all prompts to date and updated metadata. | db9fca7 | /workspace/codex_experiment_01 | Current working branch |
| 2026-02-06 18:41:06 UTC | Can you update the prompts so that it is in the form of a table with one row for each prompt? | Converted prompt log entries into a table format. | 66ca545 | /workspace/codex_experiment_01 | Current working branch |
| 2026-02-06 19:05:39 UTC | I would like to refactor this repository to be a collection of CesiumJS experiments: the current webapp being one of many. Design the home page (README.md) to have a simple but attractive looking matrix of experiment names, short descriptions and thumbnails. Clicking on the cell will open the CesiumJS experiment webapp. Each CesiumJS experimental webapp should be in a separate directory. I am not fond of the color scheme used in the current webapp: change to a more spring time color theme. | Refactored the repository into an experiments layout, added README experiment matrix, and refreshed the Observation Explorer palette. | 0e2aeca | /workspace/codex_experiment_01 | Current working branch |
| 2026-02-06 19:05:39 UTC | The user was unsatisfied with the code that the agent previously produced, which can be found as the latest commit in the git history. The prompt table was not updated as previously requested. How can I set that up as a standing order for every task? | Added standing instructions guidance and updated the prompt log. | Pending (current change) | /workspace/codex_experiment_01 | Current working branch |
| 2026-02-06 20:12:58 UTC | Build a CesiumJS experimental app that loads Sentinel-2 COGs, supports RGB/NDVI rendering, and adds a timeline with temporal zoom. | Rebuilt the observation explorer into a Sentinel-2 GeoTIFF timeline viewer with mode toggles and timeline controls. | d04ee9b | /workspace/codex_experiment_01 | Current working branch |
| 2026-02-07 13:40:56 UTC | Add optional API entry for GeoTIFF catalog on the CesiumJS start page. | Added optional API endpoint input on the start page and wired app loading to fetch GeoTIFF metadata from the API. | 9e8d183 | /workspace/codex_experiment_01 | work |
| 2026-02-07 13:52:39 UTC | Update the home page to allow pasting the GeoTIFF catalog API payload and document the API. | Added a payload paste option, session handling, and a new API guide page for catalog responses. | 3405987 | /workspace/codex_experiment_01 | work |
